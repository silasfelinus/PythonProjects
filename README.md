# Python Projects
Various smaller python projects that don't justify their own repo.

Projects from:

Impractical Python Projects  by Lee Vaughan https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects
Python Crash Course Manual by E. H. Matthes https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/
Codewars https://www.codewars.com/
Various random tinkerings.

This is an unsorted collection, created before I transitioned into github, and has been added after the fact for posterity.
